<h1>Undergraduate Research Project</h1>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/monoshizmkhan/Bangla-Abstractive-Text-Summarization">Bangla Abstractive Text Summarization using Encoder-Decoder Model (2019)</a></h2>
A research project on constructing a dataset for the task of abstractive text summarization in Bangla, and constructing a <b>deep learning</b> based model capable of using said dataset. The dataset was constructed after translating the GigaWord dataset for the task of abstractive summarization in English. The model was written in <b>Python</b> using <b>Tensorflow</b> modules. The research was conducted as part of the fourth year final project. Research was conducted under the supervison of <a href="http://www.cse.du.ac.bd/profile/?faculty=AHK">Dr. Muhammad Asif Hossain Khan</a>, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka.
This work has been submitted to the special issue "Special Issue on Deep Learning for Low-Resource Natural Language Processing" (2020) of the journal ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing (TALLIP).<br><br><br>
