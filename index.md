A web-based application for the purpose of storing, sharing and viewing undergrad research projects. Written in **Python** and **JavaScript** as the Internet Programming Lab project in the seventh semester (2019),




# Undergraduate Research Project

## [Bangla Abstractive Text Summarization (2019)](https://github.com/monoshizmkhan/Bangla-Abstractive-Text-Summarization)
A research project on constructing a dataset for the task of abstractive text summarization in Bangla, and constructing a **deep learning** based model capable of using said dataset. The dataset was constructed after translating the GigaWord dataset for the task of abstractive summarization in English. The model was written in **Python** using **Tensorflow** modules. The research was conducted as part of the fourth year final project. Research was conducted under the supervison of [Dr. Muhammad Asif Hossain Khan](http://www.cse.du.ac.bd/profile/?faculty=AHK), Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka.
This work has been submitted to the special issue "Special Issue on Deep Learning for Low-Resource Natural Language Processing" (2020) of the journal ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing (TALLIP).
